# Kiwi-T9
Implement a number to word list converter as a Node backend and React frontend.

### You can view a preview at [here](https://daiant.github.io/Kiwi-T9)!

This version has a mockup backend because github only serves static pages.
However, the project can be downloaded and run in a local environment.

## Installation
Download the code and run 
```
cd server && npm run start
```
Hoping you get a blast!
